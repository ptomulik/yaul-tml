Template Metaprogramming Library

Overview
--------

The TML library is a general-purpose C++ template metaprogramming library
with compile-time algorithms, sequences and metafunctions. It's my few-week
excercize to better understand the C++ templates and metaprogramming. It's
inspired by `Boost.MPL`_ and `tinympl`_. It tries to preserve the
`Boost.MPL`_'s concepts and interfaces while adding few new concepts and
features. The implementation of TML makes use of the C++11 features, resulting
in smaller code base.

Status
------

It's just the beginning. Many things are missing or incomplete.

Features
--------

Sequences
^^^^^^^^^

The TML introduces new sequence class called ``sequence``. It models what I
call a *Variadic Template Sequence*. The concept of *Template Sequence* makes
an explicit assumption, that sequence is an instantiation ``X<a0,...a{n-1}>``
of some template class ``X`` with type parameters, and ``a0,...,a{n-1}`` are
then the elements of the sequence. A *Variadic Template Sequence* is a
refinement of *Template Sequence* with ``X`` being a variadic template.

At the moment I'm focussed on these *Template Sequences*, so sequence
metafunctions are implemented only for *Template Sequences*. There is no
support for MPL sequences such as ``vector`` or ``list`` and probably will
never be (it's not decided yet, but it seems to be no point to reimplement
already existing features).


Classes
```````

- [ ] vector
- [ ] list
- [ ] deque
- [ ] set
- [ ] map
- [ ] range_c
- [ ] vector_c
- [ ] list_c
- [ ] set_c
- [ ] string
- [x] sequence (new)

Views
`````

- [ ] empty_sequence
- [ ] filter_view
- [ ] iterator_range
- [ ] joint_view
- [ ] single_view
- [ ] transform_view
- [ ] zip_view

Intrinsic Metafunctions
```````````````````````

There are two new intrinsic metafunctions: ``apply_sequence`` and
``sequence_generator``. The ``apply_sequence`` is used to pass elements of
a sequence as arguments to a *Lambda Expression*. The ``sequence_generator``
metafunction is used to obtain a *Sequence Generator* ``G`` for a particular
sequence, such that one can generate concept-identical sequences by just
applying new elements to ``G``.
